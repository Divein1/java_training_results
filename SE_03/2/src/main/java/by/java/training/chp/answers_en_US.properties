1 During the initial setup of your new Xbox console, you select a locale, which is the pairing of a supported language together with a country or region. You select the language is first, and then the list of countries and regions is provided, based on the language you selected, to make sure you select a supported pairing.
2 After setup of your new Xbox One console, the only way to change locale is through Settings on the Home screen. A system restart will be required. For more information, see Xbox One system settings.
3 No. We've simplified the experience across both the console and the Xbox Live service. Xbox One will always use the locale on the console selected during setup for country/region and language. This information gets passed to the Xbox Live service to show the correct marketplace, offers, recommendations, etc.
4 No. The Xbox 360 console used the locale you set during your setup, while Xbox stores used your Xbox Live account locale. This sometimes resulted in mixed locales, which was confusing. This is no longer an issue in Xbox One, which will always use the locale set by you on your console.
5 You will be shown information in the language set on your console. Your Xbox Live account locale is no longer used to show stores information.
6 No. You can simply change your console locale anytime you want. Account migration is not required in Xbox One.
